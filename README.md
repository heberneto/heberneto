Hi! Welcome to my repository!

As a new member of GitHub (and also a beginner on programming, specially about Swift language), I'd like to share with you my small
repository of codes for studies and also for helping another programmers, who like me are initiating this new world of algorythms
and development. 
I'm always seeking for knowledge about programming, and perhaps get cleared about new projects on Swift programming using this
powerful tool. So, feel free to use my codes and post any comments or suggestions. I'm very opened to see what you think about
my style of coding. 

That's it. This is a little introduce about me and what I'm looking for. Thank you and welcome to my profile. I hope to help you
as might as I can.

Kind Regards,

Heber Neto
